    name: "Eggplant Parmesan",
    description:
      "The distinct layers of breaded eggplant, rich tomato sauce and melted cheeses are what make this version of the Italian American classic perfectly calibrated (and, frankly, easy to make). Eggplant Parmesan is a labor of love, but this recipe streamlines the process so the cooking can feel relaxing on a Sunday afternoon. Long sheets of panko-breaded eggplant slices crisp up gloriously in the oven on a sheet pan, which means no frying. Store-bought jarred marinara sauce works beautifully here, but homemade can lend its own kind of delicious character (see Tip). A fully baked and cooled eggplant Parmesan will keep in the freezer, tightly covered, for up to 3 months.",
    favorite: false,
    ingredients: ["2 medium globe eggplants (about 2½ pounds), stems trimmed", 
    "Salt", "1 cup all-purpose flour", "4 large eggs, beaten","4 cups/10½ ounces panko bread crumbs","Olive oil",
"2 (24-ounce) jars store-bought marinara sauce (or use homemade; see Tip)","Fresh basil"],
    instructions: [
      "Arrange two racks on the top third and bottom third of the oven. Heat the oven to 425 degrees.",
      "Cut the eggplants lengthwise into ½-inch-thick slices. Salt both sides and let sit across two sheet pans to sweat for 10 minutes.",
      "Prepare a breading station with three wide, shallow bowls. Add the flour to one bowl, the eggs to another and the panko to the third. Pat the eggplant slices dry, dip each in the flour, then the beaten eggs and finally the panko, really packing on the bread crumbs with your hands.",
      "Generously grease the two sheet pans with olive oil and place the breaded eggplant in a single layer across both pans. Bake until crispy, switching the positions of the pans halfway through, about 30 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, to a large saucepan, add the marinara sauce and a sprig of basil. Fill one of the empty marinara sauce jars with ½ cup water, swish around, then pour into the second jar and swish again; pour this tomatoey water into the saucepan. Bring to a simmer over medium-high and cook, stirring constantly, until heated through, about 5 minutes. Taste and add salt if desired.",
      "Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking pan or casserole dish (and set it on a sheet pan, if desired, to catch any potential spillover). Put down half of the baked eggplant in a single layer, cutting any pieces to make them fit. Cover with half of the sauce (about 2½ cups). Then, sprinkle over half of the mozzarella, followed by half of the Parmesan. Add a few basil leaves over the top. Top with another layer of the remaining eggplant, followed by the remaining sauce, then the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan. Bake on the bottom rack, uncovered, until browned on top and bubbly at the edges, 25 to 30 minutes.",
      "For clean slices and distinct layers, let the pan cool for at least 30 minutes before cutting into it. Before serving, top with more basil leaves.",

    name: "Reverse-Seared Steak",
    description: "Reverse-searing is a grilling technique for steak that ensures a dark, sizzling crust and a rosy center that is perfectly cooked to your desired degree of doneness. This brilliant grilling method combines the low and slow cooking of traditional barbecue with the high heat charring practiced at steakhouses. Though it works well with any thick steak, from picanha to porterhouse, this recipe calls for a cut of steak popularized in Santa Maria, Calif., and is today known and loved across the U.S. as tri-tip. As the name suggests, it’s a triangular or boomerang-shaped steak cut from the tip of the sirloin, blessed with a robust beefy flavor.",
    favorite: false,
    ingredients: ["1 large or 2 small wood chunks (such as oak, hickory or mesquite) or 1½ cups wood chips", 
    "Canola oil, for greasing the grill grate", 
    "1 tri-tip steak (about 2 to 2¼ pounds; see Tip)", 
    "Coarse kosher or sea salt",
"Freshly ground black pepper",
"Granulated onion or garlic (or both)"],
    instructions: [
      "If using wood chips, soak in water for 30 minutes. Set up your grill for indirect grilling and heat to 250 degrees. Clean and oil the grill grate.",
      "Remove the tri-tip from the refrigerator. Generously season it with salt, pepper and granulated onion or garlic (or both) on all sides.",
      "Place the tri-tip, fat side up, on the grill grate away from the heat. Insert a remote thermometer probe, if using, deep into the center of the meat. If you soaked wood chips, drain them. If using a charcoal grill, add the wood chunk(s) or chips to the coals. If using a gas grill, place the wood chunks under the grate over one of the burners, or place the chips in your grill’s smoker box. Close the lid. Indirect grill the tri-tip to obtain an internal temperature of 110 degrees, which will take 30 minutes or so. Transfer the tri-tip to a platter and let it rest for at least 10 minutes, or as long as 1 hour.",
      "Just before serving, heat your grill to high. On a charcoal grill, rake the coals into a mound in the center of the grill, adding fresh coals as needed. Let the new coals burn until glowing red. On a gas grill, simply set the burners on high.",
      "Return the tri-tip to the grate directly over the heat, fat side up, and reinsert the thermometer probe, if using. Direct grill until the top and bottom are sizzling, crusty and dark, and the internal temperature is 125 degrees for rare or 135 degrees for medium-rare, 3 to 6 minutes per side, turning with tongs.",
      "Transfer the tri-tip to a cutting board and thinly slice across the grain. (You do not need to rest the meat a second time.) Take time to notice the even color and doneness of the meat and to appreciate the intoxicating aroma of the wood smoke. Serve at once, while the steak is still hot."
